# Scholarship Application Form

A responsive and functional **Scholarship Application Form** built using **HTML, CSS, and JavaScript**.  
Developed as part of a web development learning assignment to practice **form structure**, **styling**, and **client-side validation**.

## Overview
This project demonstrates how to create a well-structured and user-friendly form with built-in JavaScript validation.  
It collects key user details such as **Full Name, Email, Password, Qualification**, and **Department**, ensuring that all inputs are validated before submission.

## Features
- Fully functional form with real-time JavaScript validation  
- Clean, responsive, and professional design  
- Email and password format verification  
- Qualification (radio buttons) and Department (dropdown) validation  
- Beginner-friendly code structure and logic  

## Technologies Used
- **HTML5** – For form structure and semantic layout  
- **CSS3** – For styling, responsiveness, and layout design  
- **JavaScript (ES6)** – For form validation and interactivity  

## How It Works
1. The user fills in all required fields in the form.  
2. JavaScript performs the following checks:
   - Empty field detection  
   - Valid email format  
   - Password length (minimum 6 characters)  
   - Matching password confirmation  
   - Qualification and Department selection  
3. If any validation fails → An alert message is shown to the user.  
4. If all fields are valid → A success message appears:  
   **“Form submitted successfully!”**
