This project is a Scholarship Application Form created using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.
It was built as part of a web development learning assignment to practice form structure, styling, and client-side validation.

The form collects essential user information such as full name, email, password, qualification, and department.
It also validates all inputs before submission, ensuring a smooth and error-free user experience.

Features:-

Fully functional form with real-time JavaScript validation
Clean, responsive, and professional design
Password and email format validation
Qualification (radio buttons) and department (dropdown) verification
Simple and beginner-friendly code structure

Technologies Used:-

HTML5 – For page structure and form elements
CSS3 – For styling and layout
JavaScript (ES6) – For input validation and interactivity

How It Works:-

1. User fills in all required fields.

2. JavaScript checks for:

Empty fields
Valid email format
Password length (min 6 characters)
Matching password confirmation
Qualification & department selection

3. If any field is missing or invalid → An alert message appears.

4. If everything is valid → A success message “Form submitted successfully!” is displayed.
